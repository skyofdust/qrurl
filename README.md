# Scan For Share

This feature allows you to quickly share your currently open web page to devices which support qr code scanner. It shows an image of the qr code of your page in the bottom corner, making it easy to share with anyone.

It works automatically on any web page and no additional configuration is needed. If you have single page application, it is enough to enable the feature on the first page.
